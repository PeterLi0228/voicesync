# Placeholder Audio File

This is a placeholder for the original audio file. In a real implementation, this would be the actual uploaded audio file that users want to translate and dub.

To use real audio files:
1. Replace this file with actual MP3 audio content
2. Update the src paths in the AudioPlayer components
3. Implement proper file serving from your backend or CDN
