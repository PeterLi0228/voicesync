# Placeholder Translated Audio File

This is a placeholder for the translated/dubbed audio file. In a real implementation, this would be the AI-generated dubbed audio in the target language.

To use real audio files:
1. Replace this file with actual MP3 audio content generated by your AI dubbing service
2. Update the src paths in the AudioPlayer components
3. Implement proper file serving from your backend or CDN
